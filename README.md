# üéº Music by the Numbers: Spotify Wrapped Analysis  


## üéØ Project Objective:

To create a personalized Spotify Wrapped dashboard that provides a comprehensive view of the user's listening habits over the years. The dashboard will showcase trends in listening behavior by year, month, weekday, and time of day, while also highlighting personal music preferences, such as favorite artists, tracks, and albums. The goal is to deliver an engaging, data-driven summary of the user's unique music journey.

## üõ¢ Dataset:

The data for this project is sourced from the Maven Analytics website and can be accessed via the following link:
[Maven Music Challenge](https://mavenanalytics.io/challenges/maven-music-challenge/e161353d-9967-4297-869c-505de168e610)

It contains two CSV files:

1. **spotify_data_dictionary:** A reference file describing the dataset's columns.
2. **spotify_history:** The primary dataset used in this project.

The spotify_history file includes detailed information such as:

- spotify_track_uri: Unique identifier for each track.
- ts: Timestamp (in UTC).
- platform: Platform used for streaming the track.
- ms_played: Playback duration in milliseconds.
- track_name: Name of the track.
- artist_name: Artist of the track.
- album_name: Album of the track.
- reason_start: Reason the track started playing.
- reason_end: Reason the track stopped playing.
- shuffle: Shuffle status (True/False).
- skipped: Skipped status (True/False).

The analysis covers data from 2013 to 2024, offering valuable insights into listening habits and personal music preferences.

## üßπÔ∏è Data Cleaning Steps:

#### Removed Noisy Tracks:

- Filtered out tracks with a playback duration of ‚â§30 seconds, as they indicate minimal interaction and primarily add noise, skewing the results.

#### Ensured Consistency:

- Used Power Query to clean and standardize the data for further processing.

## üìä Data Preparation Steps:

#### Extracted Playback Duration:

- From the ms_played column, created two new columns to extract playback duration in seconds and minutes for easier analysis.

#### Extracted and Organized Dates:

- Extracted the date from the ts (timestamp) column and created a separate Date column for time-based analysis.

#### Created a Calendar Table:

- Built a calendar table in Power Query with the following fields:

  - Year, Date, Month Name, Month (for sorting), Week of Month, Weekdays, and Weekday Sort (for sorting), Month_name_short (for specific visual), Week_Name_full (for specific visual).

#### Generated Unique Track Identifiers:

- Created a calculated column in DAX to generate a unique_uri_track column, ensuring accurate identification of tracks with the same title but different identifiers.

#### Added Daytype Classification:

- Created a calculated column in the calendar table using DAX to classify dates as weekday or weekend for time-based analysis.

#### Time Period Categorization:

- Created a calculated column in DAX to determine the time of day from the timestamp, enabling the identification of the most active time periods.
